    "* All valuations of derivatives needs to take place within a **market model** - a simplified description of a market\n",
    "* The market model must avoid **arbitrage opportunities (NA)** and have **no free lunches with vanishing risk (NFLVR**\n",
    "* The central result is the **Fundamental Theorem of Asset Pricing**, which admits an **Equivalent Martingale Measure** making all asset prices equivalent - and reducing the market model to a single parameter - the risk-free rate.\n",
    "* For individual options, this mean their pricing is governed solely by their volatility, strike, expiry etc.\n",
    "* Fundamentally, derivative pricing computationally is the process of transforming continuous time processes into analytical formulas in discrete time."

    "* Consider an economy over a fixed time ${[0, T] \\in \\mathbb{R}_{+}}$, with T as the **terminal date**\n",
    "* At t=0, there is uncertainty of the true state of the economy at T, but the set of possible states is know.\n",
    "* The set of all possible future states ${\\omega}$ is called the **state space** and denoted ${\\Omega}$\n",
    "* The power set of observable events ${\\mathbb{P(\\Omega)}}$ is the largest algebra in ${\\Omega}$\n",
    "* The family ${\\mathbb{F}}$ defines an algebra in ${\\Omega}$\n",
    "* On ${\\mathbb{F}}$ we define a probability measure P\n",
    "* Putting this all together, with the collection ${\\mathbb{F}, \\Omega, P}$ we have a **probability space**\n",
    "* A random variable/vector is denoted S and is F-measurable; meaning that the output of the random variable draw has a measurable mapping onto future states in F\n",
    "* **Expectation** the expected value of a random variable is the sum of its expected values, probability weighted: ${E^{p}[S] = \\sum_{\\omega \\in \\Omega} P(\\omega) * S(\\omega)}$\n",
    "* **Filtration** - the filtration ${F}$ is a non-decreasing family of algebras in ${\\Omega}$ over the time dimension. Meaning uncertainty of states is ${F_{0} = [\\emptyset, \\Omega]}$ and known states is ${F_{T} = P(\\Omega)}$. Intutively, **nothing is known at the start of the economy and everything is known at the end.**\n",
    "* **Stochastic Process** A stochastic process is a data-ordered sequence of random variables ${ S_{t}, t \\in [0, ..., T]}$\n",
    "* **Adaptation**: Security price processes must be adapted to the state of information in the economy, formally ${S_{t}}$ is F-measurable. However, sometimes information is generated by the price process itself, which leads to…\n",
    "* **Algebra Generation** - The information denoted by security process S is denoted by ${F(S)}$ and is the smallest algebra with respect to which S is measurable. Of course the stochastic process is **adapted** to its self generated information\n",
    "* **Stopping Time**: A random variable is a ${F_{t}}$ stopping time if ${\\omega : \\tau(\\omega) \\leq t \\in F_{t}}$ for all ${0 \\leq t \\leq T}$. ${\\tau}$ here maps the state space to a particular time.\n",
    "* **Conditional Expectation**: Conditional expectation means that the variable/vector S satisfies a knowledge of all information/expected values currently presents at stopping time ${t}$ in the economy. This gives rise to…\n",
    "* **Martingale**: A stochastic process is a martingale if expected value ${E}$ at time ${t + s}$ (or ${t + \\Delta t}$ reflects all information around probabilities at time ${t + s}$ The probability measure ${Q}$ that makes this stochastic process a martingale is called a **Martingale Measure**\n",
    "* **Radon-Nikodym derivative** : For a P-equivalent probability measure Q, the Radon-Nikodym derivaive L (which is a random variable) is defined by ${\\forall \\omega \\in \\Omega : L(\\omega) \\equiv Q(\\omega)/P(\\omega)  \\mathrm{ for} P != 0}$ - intuitively meaning that in continuous time, all states probability is a random variable\n",
