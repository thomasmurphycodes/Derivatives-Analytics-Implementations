    "# Why Calibration?\n",
    "* In a *narrow sense*, market incompleteness implies that a given derivative cannot be replicated perfectly by trading in the underlying.\n",
    "* In the *wider sense* - admitting jumps - market incompleteness implies a given derivative cannot be replicated perfectly even if trading in all assets (underlying and derivatives) is allowed.\n",
    "* Tankov and Voltchkova - \"Since typically the jump size is not known in advance, the risk associated to jumps cannot be hedged away completely: we are in an incomplete market. In this setting, the hedging becomes an approximation problem: instead of *replicating* an option, one tires to *minimze* the residula hedging error.\""

    "# Incomplete Market Example - Motivation for Calibration\n",
    "* Consider a simple market with two dates ${t \\in [0, 1]}$ and three states of the economy at t=1 that occur with equal probability.\n",
    "* There are two assets, a bond that pays ${B_{1} = 10}$ and ${B_{0} = 10 = (1+r)^{-1}}$ meaning r = 0. Second, a risky security which costs ${S_{0} = 10}$ and pays tomorrow ${S_{1} = }$\\begin{pmatrix} 20 \\\\ 10 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n",
    "* Because the number of future states is greather than the number of available assets, the system is underdetermined and not every payoff can be replicated.\n",
    "* Because of this, the system is non-deterministic but admits a range of prices consistent with the risk-neutral probability measure with upper and lower bounds of occurrence.\n",
    "* This is an unsatisfactory answer for quants - as it admits multiple prices for a derivate. To resolve the problem, **introduce calibration**\n",
    "* The key idea here is that **there are so many possible risk-neutral probability measures, you must ask the market for the right one**"
